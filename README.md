# Kindle Comic Converter Volume Organiser
Script to sort manga/comic chapters from HakuNeko and other sources into volumes *semi-manually and archive to .zip format/rename extension to .cbz for Kindle Comic Converter (KCC).
KCC can then be used to optimise the manga/comic into a manga/webtoon format for kindle and other e-reader devices.

Note: does not work for chapter names with numbers before chapter number.

For example,

'Z= 27' for chapter 27 would work.
'Chapter 27' for chapter 27 would work.
'S2 - Vol3 Chapter 27' for chapter 27 would NOT work.

To resolve this, you could make a script to change the name of your chapter folders into one that does not include numbers before the chapter number.

*via wikipedia or some fandom page where volume chapter-breakdowns are displayed and you would just need to input the end chapters for each volume.


First time doing anything useful, so code is probably horrendously unoptimised and lacking efficient methods to do the same task. Would appreciate any feedback or improvements. :)
